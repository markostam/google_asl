## Process and Teamwork for ML

### focus on the user

+ focus on the user and all else follows
+ find what technology can help
+ build the technology
+ idea of the MOBILE - built for adults not the kids (actual users)

+ "shifting your perspective is better than being smart" -astro teller

### experimental thinking

+ the prototyping effect
  + testing things is actually way faster and way easier than sitting around and guessing
+ with prototypning
  + less ideas tride
  more slow failuers
  + less fast failures
  + less successes
+ without prototyping
  + more ideas tried
  + almost no slow failures 
  + much more fast failuers
  + slightly more successes

### bias towards action
