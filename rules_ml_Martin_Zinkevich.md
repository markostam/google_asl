# Rules of Machine Learning

+ Martin Zinkevich

## Guiding Principle

+ Key to being a great ML engineer is to be a great software engineer
+ Test, track, write simple code, learn from mistakes

## Before Machine Learning

1. Don't be afraid to launch a product without machine learning
  + test against heuristics
2. Use ML when your heuristics are insanely complex
6. Be careful about dropped data when copying pipelines!!
  + pipelines may be tuned to old data

## During ML

29. Log features at scoring time
  + 

## Unwritten Rules

1. have breakfast with your learners once a week
  + is data flowing
  + is the model exported
  + is the model the right size
  + is the performance what you need
2. Consider learning stability
  + is a continuously learning system crashing an burining?
3. Have business logic and ML play nicely together
  + put heuristics into the model, don't add them after
  + 
4. Discuss objectives with users and machines
  + short term
    + cicks
    + conversion
    + revenue
    + comments
  + med term
    + dl per day
    + rev per day
  + long term
    + happiness of users
    + view of stuff
